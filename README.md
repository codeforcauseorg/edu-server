6). Setting Up mongoDB and nest as databases for the project:-

Step 1 ‚Äî Download the MongoDB MSI Installer Package
Head over here (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and download the current version of MongoDB. Make sure you select MSI as the package you want to download.

Step 2 ‚Äî Install MongoDB with the Installation Wizard
A. Make sure you are logged in as a user with Admin privileges. Then navigate to your downloads folder and double click on the .msi package you just downloaded. This will launch the installation wizard.


B. Click Next to start installation.

G. Click Install to begin installation.

F. Hit Finish to complete installation.


Step 3‚Äî Create the Data Folders to Store our Databases
A. Navigate to the C Drive on your computer using Explorer and create a new folder called data here.

B. Inside the data folder you just created, create another folder called db.

Step 4 ‚Äî Setup Alias Shortcuts for Mongo and Mongod
Once installation is complete, we‚Äôll need to set up MongoDB on the local system.
A. Open up your Hyper terminal running Git Bash.
B. Change directory to your home directory with the following command:
cd ~
C. Here, we‚Äôre going to create a file called .bash_profile using the following command:
touch .bash_profile

vim .bash_profile
E. In vim, hit the I key on the keyboard to enter insert mode.

F. In your explorer go to C ‚Üí Program Files ‚Üí MongoDB ‚Üí Server
Now you should see the version of your MongoDB.

G. Paste in the following code into vim, make sure your replace the 4.0 with your version that you see in explorer
alias mongod="/c/Program\ files/MongoDB/Server/4.0/bin/mongod.exe"
alias mongo="/c/Program\ Files/MongoDB/Server/4.0/bin/mongo.exe"
F. Hit the Escape key on your keyboard to exit the insert mode. Then type
:wq!
to save and exit Vim.

Step 5 ‚Äî Verify That Setup was Successful
